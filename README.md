# Rectifying-Your-Ellipse
In the former project "Perfecting-Your-Drawing", i fitted the ellipses using the general quadratic form, a x^2  + b xy + c x^2 y + d x + e y  =  1.  
This approaches has many drawbacks. In this project, i will find the standard form of the ellipse best approxmating to the drawing with two new algorithms. 

## Problems
- the quadratic form is not only for ellipse. It is for all kinds of conic sections, including circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola. How to tell the shape of the drawing? 
- the quadratic form is not the standard ellipse we are familar with, as shown in Figure 1. From the coefficients in general quadratic form, we do not know what the parameters of the ellipse, such as the width and the height.
